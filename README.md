# sem-data-analysis-VAE

Creating a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for the FZI seminar.

- Seminar_VAE contains all python files
- Files with COLAB should be executed on Google Colab since they are very CPU/GPU heavy. Use Hardware Accelerator on Colab Notebooks (Edit > Notebook settings > Hardware Accelerator > GPU)
